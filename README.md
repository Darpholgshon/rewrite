# rewrite

The purpose of the rewrite script is to eliminate the 1-to-1 mapping between files and MarkLogic App Servers by introducing a intermediate layer that recognizes URLs and dispatches them to application code.

This project also tries to help you to make security part of this process by introducing XQuery constraints.

rewrite is designed to work with [MarkLogic][2] Server only. However it can easily be ported to another product that understands XQuery and has similar capabilities.

rewrite is heavily inspired in the [Rails 3.0 routing][4].

## Usage

Not yet

Routes order matters, if one rules comes before other and both match the first match will be used.

* Install
* Point app Server to rewrite
* Makes routes and supporting XQuery
* Done

Check features for a description of what the `routes.xml` file translates to.

## Sample Application

Not yet.

## Contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute. 

1. Fork rewrite in github
2. Create a new branch - `git checkout -b my-branch`
3. Test your changes
4. Commit your changes
5. Push to your branch - `git push origin my-branch`
6. Create an pull request

The documentation is severely lacking. Feel free to contribute to the wiki if 
you think something could be improved.

### Running the tests

To run the tests simply point an MarkLogic HTTP AppServer to the root of rewrite

You can run the tests by accessing:
(assuming 127.0.0.1 is the host and 8090 is the port)

    http://127.0.0.1:8090/test

Make sure all the tests pass before sending in your pull request!

### Report a bug

If you want to contribute with a test case please file a [issue][1] and attach 
the following information:

* Not yet

This will help us be faster fixing the problem.

An example for a Hello World test would be:

      Not yet

This is not the actual test that we run (you can see a list of those in test/index.xqy) but it's all the information we need for a bug report.

## Supported Functionality

In this section we describe the DSL that you can use to define your routes
and what is generated based on it.

The following sections assume the following configuration for controller paths:

     <notyet/>

####  âœ” root
     Route         : <root> server#version </root>
     Dispatches to : 


### Roadmap

If you are interested in any of these (or other) feature and don't want to wait just read the instructions
on "Contribute" and send in your code

* Not yet.

### Known Limitations

In this section we have the know limitations excluding the features that are not supported. 
To better understand what is supported refer to the Supported Features section

* Special handlers like :id and :database are passed as normal parameters. This means your if your user/form provides an id as well you will have two :ids, one for the request and another for what comes from the post. The first one is always the special :id and the subsequent ones are whatever the user gave you. Need to write this up a little better
